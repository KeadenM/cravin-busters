# Cravin' Busters

It's that time of the day again. You and your significant other are fighting over what to pick for dinner.

"I picked last time!"

"Yeah, well I picked it up!"

"You always pick the same three places!"

It's time to put those arguments to rest, save your relationship, and let Cravin' Busters decide!

Click the "Let's eat!" button, and our algorithm will generate a random restaurant near you. The Geolocation API starts by getting your location (with your permission, of course) and then converts the location to latitude and longitude. The location is then run through Bing's API to get your city and state. Finally, it is fed into Yelp's API to generate a random restaurant.

## Feelin' picky? 

Hit the "I'm picky" button to narrow down your searches. You can pick from a list of different cuisine options depending on what you're feeling.

In the future, you will be able to also narrow down your searches by price and distance.
